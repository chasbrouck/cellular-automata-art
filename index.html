		<h1>An Artistic Exploration of Cellular Automaton</h1>

		<p class="margins">My project takes various pieces of art and uses them as a blue print for cellular automaton. Each piece of art is broken up by a grid and filled with active cells based on its various colors. Each color exists as its own layer and is unaffected by the active states of other layers. The more prominent colors of each artwork exist as the base layer of the animation. This allows colors of little dominance to remain present in the final work.</p>
